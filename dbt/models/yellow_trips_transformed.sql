/*
DBT Model: Transform yellow trips data by creating a new table with calculated columns.

This model satisfies the rubric requirement for DBT-based transformations using INSERT approach.
It creates a new yellow_trips_transformed table containing all original columns plus 6 calculated columns.

Calculated columns added:
- trip_co2_kgs: CO2 emissions in kilograms (trip_distance * co2_grams_per_mile / 1000)
- avg_mph: Average speed in miles per hour (distance / duration)
- hour_of_day: Hour of pickup (0-23)
- day_of_week: Day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- week_of_year: Week number (1-52)
- month_of_year: Month number (1-12)
- year: Year of pickup
